# Personal_Finance_Manager
This project was created using **Python**!

The project turns my monthly bank statement into efficiently readable Google sheets information.
The statement is downloaded in CSV format, this is then formatted for relevant information and then added to Google sheets using the Sheets API.


Relevant Python Libraries:
- Pandas for data handling
- Decimal for precise multiplication
- Gsheets for google sheets editing
